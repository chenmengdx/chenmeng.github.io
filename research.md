# Brief Biography

I'm currently a **Research Scientist** at **Dragon ASR Research Department** of [Nuance Communications](http://www.nuance.com/index.htm). My research focus on **Language Modeling and Understanding**. The specific application scenario includes **Automatic Speech Recognition**, **Mobile Text Input System**, and **Computer Assisted Language Learning** etc. I received my Master of Science Degree from [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.gucas.ac.cn/) in 2012. My supervisor is [Prof. Helen Meng](http://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/hmmeng.html). I mainly worked with [Dr. Lan Wang](http://sourcedb.cas.cn/sourcedb_siat_cas/yw/zjrc/200907/t20090713_2066858.html) and [Dr. Dean Luo](http://sourcedb.cas.cn/sourcedb_siat_cas/yw/zjrc/201103/t20110317_3087387.html) on automatic scoring of pronunciation in oral English test during my graduated university. I got my Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science from [University of Science & Technology Beijing](http://www.ustb.edu.cn/). I was an Assistant Researcher at [Sogou Speech Team](https://www.sogou.com/) from 2012 to 2013. I was also an Intern in [Microsoft China](https://www.microsoft.com/zh-cn) in 2009.
