My research focus on **Language Modeling and Understanding**. The specific application scenario includes **Automatic Speech Recognition**, **Mobile Text Input System**, and **Computer Assisted Language Learning** etc. \r\nI received my Master of Science Degree from [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.gucas.ac.cn/) in 2012. My supervisor is [Prof. Helen Meng](http://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/hmmeng.html%20). I mainly worked with [Dr. Lan Wang](http://sourcedb.cas.cn/sourcedb_siat_cas/yw/zjrc/200907/t20090713_2066858.html) and [Dr. Dean Luo](http://sourcedb.cas.cn/sourcedb_siat_cas/yw/zjrc/201103/t20110317_3087387.html) on automatic scoring of pronunciation in oral English test during my graduated university. I got my Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science from [University of Science & Technology Beijing](http://www.ustb.edu.cn/). I was a Assistant Researcher at Sogou Speech Team from 2012 to 2013. I was also an Intern in Microsoft China in 2009.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n## Publications\r\n* **Meng Chen**, _\"Re-ranking Chinese Cloud Text Input Prediction with RNNLM\"_, in Nuance Research Conference 2016 (NRC 2016), 2016.\r\n* Ning Han, **Meng Chen**, and Nan He, _\"Collect and Filter Weibo for Chinese ALM Training Corpus\"_, in Nuance Research Conference 2016 (NRC 2016), 2016.\r\n* **Meng Chen** and Qi Zhang, _\"Chinese Cloud Text Input Prediction: From Core & Linguistic Perspective\"_, in Nuance Research Conference 2015 (NRC 2015), 2015.
