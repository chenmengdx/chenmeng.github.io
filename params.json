My research focus on Language Modeling and Understanding. The specific application scenario includes Automatic Speech Recognition, Mobile Text Input System, and Computer Assisted Language Learning etc. \r\nI received my Master of Science Degree from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2012. My supervisor is Prof. Helen Meng. I mainly worked with Dr. Lang Wang and Dr. Dean Luo on automatic scoring of pronunciation in oral English test during my graduated university. I got my Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science from University of Science & Technology Beijing. I was a Assistant Researcher at Sogou Speech Team from 2012 to 2013. I was also an Intern in Microsoft China in 2009.\r\n\r\n## Publications\r\n* **Meng Chen**, “Re-ranking Chinese Cloud Text Input Prediction with RNNLM”, in Nuance Research Conference 2016 (NRC 2016), 2016.\r\n* Ning Han, **Meng Chen**, and Nan He, \"Collect and Filter Weibo for Chinese ALM Training Corpus\", in Nuance Research Conference 2016 (NRC 2016), 2016.\r\n* **Meng Chen** and Qi Zhang, \"Chinese Cloud Text Input Prediction: From Core & Linguistic Perspective\", in Nuance Research Conference 2015 (NRC 2015), 2015.
